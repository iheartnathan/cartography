    # the graph in a mixed state: everything cleaned up so far reflects a
    # fresh snapshot, while resources not yet reached this run keep stale
    # data - and, worse, any node deleted by an earlier cleanup severs the
    # relationship edges other not-yet-reloaded nodes still hold to it, even
    # though those nodes themselves were never touched. Deferring every
    # cleanup to the end means a mid-sync failure aborts before any cleanup
    # runs at all - earlier loads in this same run have already committed
    # (a partial sync can still add/update nodes), but no stale node from a
    # *previous* run is deleted until every load in *this* run has
    # succeeded, instead of some stale nodes being pruned while others -
